% sample - sample input file for the graph generation program (subgen).
%
% The format of the file first defines parameters, then possible vertex
% and edge labels, and finally the substructure to be imbedded in the
% graph.  The output of subgen produces two files: substructure instances
% file and graph file.  These would be called sample.insts and sample.graph,
% respectively, for the call 'subgen sample'.

%%% Parameters (required) %%%

% Number of vertices and edges in final graph.  Must be integers.

Vertices 10
Edges 30

%%% Parameters (optional) %%%

% Connectivity is the number of external connections on each instance
% of the substructure.  The default is 1, but more connectivity may
% occur inorder to keep the entire graph connected and satisfy the
% Overlap parameter.  Must be an integer.

Connectivity 1

% Coverage is the percentage of the final graph to be covered by the
% instances of the substructure.  The value should be a real number
% between 0.0 and 1.0.  The default is 1.0.

Coverage 1.0

% Overlap is the percentage of the total instances structure that
% overlaps.  The value must be a real number between 0.0 and 1.0.
% The default is 0.0.

Overlap 0.0

% The Deviation is the average amount of deviation per instance,
% where the amount of deviation is computed as the sum of the
% weight given below (ProbSubVertexLabel, etc) for each deviation
% made to an instance.  Default is 0, meaning all instances of the
% substructure are exact matches.  Must be a real number greater
% than zero.

Deviation 0

% In order to achieve the above amount of deviation in the instances,
% the following four parameters specify the weights for each of four
% possible deviations.  In addition, a second argument specifies the
% probability that each deviation is likely to be selected.  These
% probabilities must sum to one.  As the deviations are performed,
% their weight is added to a global sum over all instances until the
% average deviation weight per instance equals the above Deviation
% parameter.  Note that a deletion can actually cause multiple
% deletions, whose weights are all added to the global sum.  Deletions
% causing the instance to become disconnected are not allowed.  Instances
% A vertex or edge whose label has been changed is no longer eligible
% for further deviation.  The first argument is the weight, and the
% second argument is the probability.  Defaults are
%
%                 Weight Probability
%  SubVertexLabel  1.0     0.25
%  SubEdgeLabel    1.0     0.25
%  DelVertex       1.0     0.10
%  DelEdge         1.0     0.40

SubVertexLabel 1.0 0.25
SubEdgeLabel   1.0 0.25
DelVertex      1.0 0.25
DelEdge        1.0 0.25

% When the graph generator attempts to delete a vertex or edge from
% instances of the substructure according to the above parameters,
% other vertices and edges may need deleting as well.  The parameters
% DelVertex2 and DelEdge2 hold the weights assigned to this internal
% deviation.  The default for both is 0.5.

DelVertex2 0.5
DelEdge2   0.5

%%% Data %%%

% All possible vertex labels should follow the VertexLabels keyword.
% Associated with each vertex label is a probability reflecting the
% frequency of the label in the randomly generated portion of the
% graph.  The probabilities for all labels must sum to one.

VertexLabels {
v1 0.2
v2 0.2
v3 0.2
v4 0.2
v5 0.2
}

% All possible edge labels should follow the EdgeLabels keyword.
% Associated with each edge label is a probability reflecting the
% frequency of the label in the randomly generated portion of the
% graph.  The probabilities for all labels must sum to one.

EdgeLabels {
e1 0.71
e2 0.29

% The vertices and edges of the substructure should be listed after
% the Substructure keyword.
