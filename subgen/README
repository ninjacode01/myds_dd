Substructure Graph Generator

To compile the subgen.c program, just type 'make'.  If you want a version
that outputs trace information, compile with 'make subgend'.  The subgen
program is called from within the sg shell script, which sends a random
number seed to the subgen program.  The syntax for the sg command call is

  sg <file>

The <file> should specify the parameters for the generator.  See the file
'sample' for documentation on the parameters and an example input file.  If
you want to try your own random number seed, or want to duplicate the
behavior of a previous seed, you can call the 'subgen' program directly

  subgen <file> <seed>

The <file> argument is the same as for sg.  The seed should be an integer
which will be used by subgen to initialize the random number generator.
To enable duplication of behavior, you may want to uncomment the line
in the sg script that echoes the seed.

The subgen program creates two files.  If your input file was named
'sample', then the two files will be 'sample.insts' and 'sample.graph'.
The '.insts' file contains the instances imbedded in the graph along with
the deviations (if any) of each instance from the original substructure.
The '.graph' file contains the complete graph in SUBDUE format along with
some approximate graph statistics in comments.  If you have compiled subgen
with the DEBUG flag set, you will also get a '.parms' file which simply
echoes the parameters from the input file.

Further documentation on inputs/outputs and a sketch of the algorithm are
in the file 'subgen.doc'.
