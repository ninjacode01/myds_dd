Graph Generator

Parameters:
- possible vertex labels
- possible edge labels
- size of graph
  - number of vertices
  - number of edges
- substructure
- connectivity
- coverage
- overlap
- deviation
  - average number of deviations per instance of substructure
  - probabilities of subvertex, subedge, delvertex, deledge
  - weights of above four plus internal delvertex, deledge

Outputs:
- instances
  - discrepancies
- graph

Algorithm:
- read in parameters
- compute number of instances I
  - (graph size * coverage) / (subsize * (1 - overlap))
- create I instances
- compute amount of common structure needed for overlap
  - (subsize * overlap), assign as a count to each instance
- merge instances until overlap achieved
  - randomly pick two instances
  - merge randomly
  - continue until overlap achieved
  - overlap = Overlap * (subsize * n_instances)
- probabilistically fuzz each instance
  - randomly select the type of deviation
  - make the selected deviation to a random instance (vertex, edge)
    - do not deviate vertices or edges previously deviated
    - maintain connectivity of instance
  - continue until average number of deviations over all instances
    is equal or greater than the deviation parameter
- build final graph from instances
- add random vertices to achieve graph vertex size
- minimally connect disconnected subgraphs with random unique edges
- add random unique edges to achieve connectivity
- add random unique edges to achieve graph edge size
- output graph
- output substructure instances

Future Enhancements:
1 random substructure generator
2 allow multiple substructures per graph
3 fuzz instances by ADDING vertices and edges
4 do not delete a vertex that has an edge leading to a vertex with
  no other edges
  - for example, (o---o---X---o), vertex = [o|X], edge = ---,
    X is the vertex to be deleted
  - currently the system would yield (o---o) upon deleting X, with
    one secondary vertex deletion and two secondary edge deletions
  - may want to prevent this (especially for small substructure
    instances) due to the large overall loss of structure
